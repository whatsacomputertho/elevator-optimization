# Elevator Optimization

This is a public archive of the initial repository I created in my effort to write an elevator simulation program in Rust.  I have refactored my initial work such that the core structs and traits are packaged as a Rust Crate, and the CLI portion of the program is its own component built atop the library.

For reference, see:

- [whatsacomputertho/elevate-cli](https://github.com/whatsacomputertho/elevate-cli): An elevator simulation CLI written in Rust, based on the `elevate-lib` package
